# Executive Summary

This project will look at the current UFC roster data and attempt to determine if there are any trends or patterns that may drive athletes towards joining this league first and their likelihood to win a World Championship second. 
Looking at different associated factors such as fighters’ biography, and records pairing with outside data, I plan to explore the top fighters having the best theoretical chance to win a world championship (or commonly called “Belt”). Given my knowledge of the recent history of this sport, I expect that there will be some details on fights’ selection that will not be disclosed on determining potential fights matchup that can lead specific athletes to winning a belt. 

# Motivation

I chose this project as I have recently gained an appreciation and respect of the protocol put in place by the UFC to host their fights in the middle of the pandemic “COVID-19” while all the other major sports were on hold. Moreover, the UFC is one of the only major company that laid off less than 1% of their workforce and triple their revenue during this pandemic. Most importantly, I want to showcase the value that all their different athletes bring to the table and the risk that they take to change their family’s lives’. 
One of the more interesting aspects of this league is not only the risk associated with getting into a fist fight, but why specific athletes choose to join the “company”? as it is called and what are the underlying criteria that makes a champion? These are the questions that I want to answer!


# Data Question

Are there factors that can be used to determine the likelihood (or lack thereof) of a fighter winning the title? (criteria such as martial arts practiced, upbringing, height / weight, country of origin, fighting stance, etc.) Are there common trends between champions that could inform or help the UFC sign prolific prospects? 


# Tools leveraged

•	Excel: convert scraped data to CSV 

•	Python; scrape the data and EDA

•	Tableau; visualize my findings


# Known Issues and Challenges

•	Scrapping the UFC and Wikipedia dataset and comparing insights to get the most reliable one. 

•	Changing formats so that the separate sources could be linked to one another via table joins. Essentially trying to format the data correctly so that tidy versions of the data could effectively be visualized in tableau.
